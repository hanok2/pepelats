# Set USB Audio as Default Audio Device

You need to disable onboard audio by editing "config.txt" and setting
dtparam=audio=off

The USB sound device most likely is loaded as "card 1", check this by using command
aplay -l

This can be made the default audio device by editing a system file “alsa.conf”:
sudo nano /usr/share/alsa/alsa.conf

Scroll and find the following two lines:
defaults.ctl.card 0
defaults.pcm.card 0
Change the 0 to a 1 to match the card number of the USB device and Save the file


Alternatively you may edit file ".asoundrc"
nano ~/.asoundrc

Add the following text:

pcm.!default {
 type hw
 card 1
}

ctl.!default {
 type hw
 card 1
}
